## Chat Room

### What's this repo
Simple TCP chat room implementation written in Golang. My first practice project for learning Golang.

### How to run
Start server first
```bash
go run server.go
```
Then start as many clients as you want:
```bash
go run client.go
```

### Result

### TODO
Still having a problem that there is an EOF error when I quit the client.
